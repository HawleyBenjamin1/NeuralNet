This is a custom neural net framework built in python using Numpy. This repo also includes the code to train a model built on the ucimlrepo heart disease data under heartDiseaseModel.

If you happen to stumble on this framework and actually want to use it, start by investigating the modelTrainer class and how it interacts with the heartDiseaseModel.
Features include simplified custom layer construction, rectified linear activation, softmax loss, and SGD with momentum for the optimizer. 

I will be adding updates as I see fit in the future including further additions to activation functions, loss functions, and updates to the optimizer. 
Perhaps in the distant future I will dip my toes into unsupervized learning with this framework. 

Thank you for checking out my code.
